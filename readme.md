# Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

This project demonstrates a cloud-based healthcare intake and analytics solution using Google Cloud Platform services. It integrates storage, compute, databases, and analytics to simulate a realistic healthcare data workflow. 

## Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates the ability to: 
* Design a healthcare-relevant cloud solution
* Integrate multiple cloud services into an end-to-end architecture
* Map services to real cloud offerings(GCP)
* Apply cost, security, and governance considerations
* Reflection on alternative architectures, strengths, and weaknesses.
