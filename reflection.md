# Reflection

I am confident in the overall architecture design and service selection, especially the integration of Flask, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL. The design is realistic and useful because these elements closely correspond with the assignments finished over the semester. I am least confident in advanced security and compliance implementation aspects, such as encryption techniques and auditing. Although I have a basic understanding of these ideas, I need more time and experience to really use them in production settings.

Using BigQuery for analytics rather than Cloud SQL was one of the alternative architectures considered. The dataset is tiny, transactional, and better suited to a relational database, so even though BigQuery is excellent for large-scale analytics, it was not selected. Also, Cloud SQL aligns better with our  curriculum and assignments this semester. 

If I had an extra 4 to 8 weeks and unlimited credits, I would implement role-based dashboards for administrators and clinicians to identify high-risk triage trends; incorporate a basic machine learning model; include monitoring and automated testing; and add charts and visualizations to the front end.
